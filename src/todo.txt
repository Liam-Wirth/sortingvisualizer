maybe remove the array data type? like its kinda depricated code now,
I dont even think I'm using it

try re implementing it all using just bevy, maybe that will be faster?
    or multithread the algorithms lol! that is probably the play, because then the rate at which
    the algorithm runs is entirely independant from the "update" function, and instead, things work
    the other way around where the update function basically just runs with every time the array is updated












if something doesnt need to hold data, dont make it.
