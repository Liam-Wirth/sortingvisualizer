maybe remove the array data type? like its kinda depricated code now,
I dont even think I'm using it

problem:
Vector is initialized, and I need to be able to store state
 dont even think I'm using itoos initialized, and I need to be able to store state  
 of the vector across different things
 





 --ideas
 maybe wrap all sorting algorithms inside of an iterator?
    How do I do that?
    I feel like this may be better than just having that dumb struct
    that weirdly holds state, cause doesnt an iterator hold it's own state?



if something doesnt need to hold data, dont make it.
