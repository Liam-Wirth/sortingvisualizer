maybe remove the array data type? like its kinda depricated code now,
I dont even think I'm using it

try re implementing it all using just bevy, maybe that will be faster?
    or multithread the algorithms lol! that is probably the play, because then the rate at which
    the algorithm runs is entirely independant from the "update" function, and instead, things work
    the other way around where the update function basically just runs with every time the array is updated












if something doesnt need to hold data, dont make it.




to implement:
multithread
Print a lot of the info to the top left of the screen
sound/ a beeper
secondary panel holding all the settings/drop down menus
sweep animation after the algorithm is sorted
have the array be generated as a sorted array, and animate the shuffling the same way arrayV does
be able to assign a different color value to each rectangle
be able to restart the algorithm
possibly show a cursor/where the thing is in the index that is animated as a different shape, instead of 
just highlighting the current rectangle red
have like a drop down menu so that the user could write their own 
implementations of any sorting algorithm they want in lua OR rust,
and have the visualizer be able to animate their code
Sysiphus sort
